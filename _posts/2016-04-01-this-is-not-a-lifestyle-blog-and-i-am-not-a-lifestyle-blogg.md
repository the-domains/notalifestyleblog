This is not a lifestyle blog, and I am not a lifestyle blogger.

As someone who works in media, I hear the word 'influencer' thrown around a lot. They get paid to post things and make it sound like it was their idea in the first place.

I'm not getting paid for this.

I like to tell my friends and family and co-workers about things I've discovered, and now I'm going to tell you, too.
